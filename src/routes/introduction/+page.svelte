	<h3>Based on Tailwind CSS</h3>
	<p>
		Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It
		provides a set of pre-built utility classes that can be combined to style elements in a
		consistent and efficient manner. This approach allows for rapid development and ensures
		consistency across different parts of a website.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tailwind CSS is designed to be highly customizable, allowing developers to extend and modify the
		framework to fit their specific needs. Tailwind CSS is a powerful tool for building responsive
		and modern web interfaces with a focus on customization and control.
	</p>

	<h3>The Need for a Design System</h3>
	<p>
		However, you may find yourself repeating the same classes over and over again. This is where the
		design system comes in.
	</p>
	<p>
		A design system is a collection of reusable components, patterns, and guidelines that help
		ensure a consistent look and feel across a website, application, or even a company. It provides
		a set of pre-built components that can be combined to style elements in a consistent and
		efficient manner. This approach allows for rapid development and ensures consistency across
		different parts of a website.
	</p>
	<p>
		The design system makes it easy to change the look and feel of a website by changing CSS
		variables. Creating a new theme or customizing the theme for various clients is as easy as
		editing CSS variables.
	</p>

	<h3>C is for Cascading</h3>
	<p>
		The power of the design system lies in the ability to extend and compose styles because of the
		cascading nature of CSS. This allows you to keep your CSS DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by
		minimizing the redundancy of declaring the same properties over and over again for slight
		variations.
